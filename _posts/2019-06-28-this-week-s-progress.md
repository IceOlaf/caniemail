Lots of progress has been made this week:

* The search engine is now fully functional.
* Clicking on a family name (ie Outlook, Gmail, â€¦) of the top three client on a feature page correctly scroll at the right position.
* Work is now done on the `master` branch on Github. (Branch `gh-pages` was removed.)
