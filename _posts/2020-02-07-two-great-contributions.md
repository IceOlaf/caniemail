Two great contributions were added to the site this week:

* James Kupczak (@jkupczak) showed how Yahoo supports [the `role` attribute](/features/html-role/) but only for `<table>` elements.
* Mark Robbins (@M-J-Robbins) added tests for a whole lot of image formats ([JPG](/features/image-jpg/), [GIF](/features/image-gif/), [PNG](/features/image-png/), [Animated PNG](/features/image-apng/), [webP](/features/image-webp/), [BMP](/features/image-bmp/), [HDR](/features/image-hdr/), [HEIF](/features/image-heif/), [ICO](/features/image-ico/), [PPM](/features/image-ppm/), [TIFF](/features/image-tiff/), [Base 64 images](/features/image-base64/), [external SVG](/features/image-svg/), [embedded &lt;svg&gt;](/features/html-svg/)).

Thank you both for contributing!
