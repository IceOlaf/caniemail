I [just did](https://twitter.com/HTeuMeuLeu/status/1504424483419041792) a livestream on Twitch about testing for Can I email. In this hour and a half stream, I covered the following:

* Installing and running Can I email
* Picking up something to test
* Writing a test
* Running the test
* Reporting results

You can [watch the full video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/pOwVh8DKNyI).
