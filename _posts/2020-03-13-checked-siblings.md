This week, we added the CSS [`:checked` pseudo-class](/features/css-pseudo-class-checked/) as well as the [adjacent sibling (`E + F`)](/features/css-selector-adjacent-sibling/) and [general sibling (`A ~ B`)](/features/css-selector-general-sibling/) combinators. Great additions to work in interactive emails!
