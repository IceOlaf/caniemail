title:  "Introducing the Can I email Embed"

You can now embed Can I email’s data on your own site, blog posts, tweets, Stack Overflow‘s answers, etc. You can either use an interactive embed (using an `<iframe>`) or a live image (using an `<img>`).

Here’s an example of an **interactive embed**.

<iframe title="Can I email… border-radius" src="https://embed.caniemail.com/css-border-radius/" width="640" height="420" style="width:100%; max-width:40rem; height:26.25rem; border:none;" loading="lazy"></iframe>

And here’s an example of an **image embed**.

<a href="https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-at-font-face/"><img src="https://screenshots.caniemail.com/css-at-font-face.png" alt="Can I email… @font-face" width="640" height="400" style="vertical-align:middle; border:0; max-width:100%; height:auto;" /></a>

Each of those is thought out to be **responsive** and **performant** (an interactive embed is only three requests and about 15 Kb gzipped while an image embed is about 40 Kb).

I’d like to send huge thanks to [Ire Aderinokun](https://twitter.com/ireaderinokun) whose work on the [CanIUse Embed](https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/) has been a huge help and inspiration.

As a nice side effect of all this, sharing a direct feature page (on Slack, Facebook, Twitter, …) will now show the live image of that feature as a preview.

You can read everything there is to know about The CanIEmail Embed at [embed.caniemail.com](https://embed.caniemail.com/) and generate your own code to embed on your site.
