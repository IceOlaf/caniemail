Hey there! Long time no see! I guess amid a global health crisis, climate change and the rise of fascism, I didn’t really have the mind to post here. But that doesn’t mean nothing happened! So, first, I cheated a bit and added two news worthy posts retro-actively:

* [Testing for Can I email, live on Twitch](/news/2022-03-17-testing-for-caniemail-twitch/), march 2022
* [Say hello to the Email Markup Consortium](/news/2022-05-25-email-markup-consortium/), may 2022

Then, thanks to contributions from @DCoder18 and @seyiusman, new CSS features have been added to the site these past months:

* [`word-break`](/features/css-word-break/)
* [`outline`](/features/css-outline/)
* [`writing-mode`](/features/css-writing-mode/)
* [`text-emphasis`](/features/css-text-emphasis/)
* [`text-emphasis-position`](/features/css-text-emphasis-position/)
* [`lang()`](/features/css-pseudo-class-lang/)
* [`margin-inline` and `margin-block`](/features/css-margin-inline/)
* [`margin-block-start-start` and `margin-block-start-end`](/features/css-margin-block-start-end/)
* [`padding-block-start-start` and `padding-block-start-end`](/features/css-padding-block-start-end/)
* [`padding-inline` and `padding-block`](/features/css-padding-inline-block/)
* [`border-inline` and `border-block`](/features/css-border-inline-block/), their [longhand properties](/features/css-border-inline-block-longhand/) and [individual logical properties](/features/css-border-inline-block-individual/)
* [`tab-size`](/features/css-tab-size/)

We also received two updates worth mentioning:

* The [`font-weight` property](/features/css-font-weight/) has been [updated](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/caniemail/commit/e90ea2b50551e92318f390f55caaaaf7aeea35dc) by [Courtney Grimes](https://twitter.com/cougrimes) with details on support for more keywords and intermediate weight values.
* The [`@media` feature](/features/css-at-media/) has been [updated](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/caniemail/commit/31ff7ab5606bb4b4e25baa8d867ff5b77d6d1e56) by [Nicole Merlin](https://twitter.com/moonstrips) with Gmail on Android supporting nested media queries (like other Gmail versions).

Finally, fellow contributor [Hussein Al Hammad](https://twitter.com/hus_hmd) has also been hard at work at adding tags to various features to better organize and visualize content. You can see the result in [the new Tags page](/tags/).
