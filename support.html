		<h1>About Estimated Support</h1>
		<p>
			In february 2020, we rolled out a new functionality called <em>Estimated support</em>. This will give you a clue of how widely supported every HTML and CSS features tested on the site is.

		<div class="feature-support">
			<p class="feature-support-title">
				Estimated support <span class="beta-tag">Beta</span>

			<div class="score">
				<div title="75.43% supported in Apple iPhone, Gmail, Apple Mail, Samsung Mail, Outlook.com." role="group" style="width:75.43%;" class="supported"></div>

			While we think this is a valuable functionality to help make technical choices, it is important to keep in mind how email tracking works and how accurate (or how inaccurate) this data can be. So here are a few things worth noting.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Outlook macOS and Windows get counted as the same.</li>
			<li>All Gmail are counted as the same.</li>
			<li>Litmus tracks email clients we don't (Apple iPad, Google Android and Windows Live Mail).</li>
			<li>Litmus top ten doesn't add up to 100%.</li>
			<li>Some email clients we track are not tracked by Litmus.</li>
		</ul>
