## Getting started

Caniemail.com runs on [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com/) as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site with a home made theme.

The site uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for CSS compilation.

1. Clone the repository. 

```
git clone https://www.github.com/hteumeuleu/caniemail.git
```

See [Cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) on GitHub documentation.

If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, I strongly encourage you to try [GitHub's desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) on macOS or Windows.

2. Install Jekyll.

```
gem install bundler jekyll
```

See [Jekyll Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

3. Run Jekyll.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

4. Go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Usage
